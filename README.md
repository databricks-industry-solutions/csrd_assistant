## CSRD assistant
*The CSRD (Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive) is a European Union initiative aimed at enhancing corporate accountability regarding sustainability matters. It mandates certain companies to disclose non-financial information (such as environmental, social, and governance factors) in their annual reports and other public disclosures. Although this initiative may pose a data quality challenge to many firms collecting (and reporting on) this information for the first time, the [directive](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:02013L0034-20240109&qid=1712714544806) itself (as per many regulatory documents) may be source of confusion / concerns and subject to various interpretation. In this solution accelerator, we demonstrate how generative AI can be used to better navigate through the complexities of regulatory filings, bringing more transparency for companies to disclose their societal impact and allowing stakeholders to make more informed decisions.*
